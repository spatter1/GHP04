* Nyhoff Page 387 #4 as follows:
*
* For a given integer n>1, the smallest integer d>1 that divides n is a prime factor.  We can find the prime
* factorization of n if we find d then replace n by the quotient of n divided by d, repeating this until n becomes
* 1.  Write a program that determines the prime factorization of n in this manner, but displays the prime factors in
* descending order.  For example, for n=3960, your program should produce:
*
*                11 * 5 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 *2
